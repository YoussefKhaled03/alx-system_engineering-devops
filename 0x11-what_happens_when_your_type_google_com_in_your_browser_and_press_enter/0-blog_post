# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter?

When you enter the URL `https://www.google.com` into your browser, a complex series of events unfolds, connecting you to one of the world's most popular search engines. Let's break down this process step by step.

## DNS Request
First, your browser needs to know the IP address associated with `www.google.com`. This is where the **Domain Name System (DNS)** comes into play. Your browser sends a DNS query over the internet to find out the IP address for the domain name.

## TCP/IP
Once the IP address is known, your browser uses the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** over the **Internet Protocol (IP)** to establish a connection with Google's server. TCP/IP ensures that packets of data are sent and received reliably.

## Firewall
Before the request leaves your computer, it passes through a **firewall**. This is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules, ensuring that only safe connections are made.

## HTTPS/SSL
The `https` in the URL indicates that the connection is secure, using **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** with **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)** encryption. This means that the information exchanged between your browser and Google's server is encrypted for privacy and security.

## Load-balancer
Google receives a massive amount of traffic, so to efficiently handle all the incoming requests, a **load-balancer** is used. This device distributes the network or application traffic across a number of servers, ensuring no single server becomes overwhelmed.

## Web Server
The load-balancer redirects your request to one of Google's **web servers**. A web server's primary function is to store, process, and deliver web pages to users.

## Application Server
The web server passes the request to an **application server** if necessary. The application server runs the application's logic, accessing data and performing computations.

## Database
For some requests, the application server will communicate with a **database** to retrieve stored information. In the case of Google, this could be your search history or preferences if you're signed in.

When the process is complete, the web server sends the requested web page back to your browser, which then displays the Google search page, ready for you to use.
